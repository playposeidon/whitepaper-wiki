## Combo of Orbs

At Hero LV8 you will be able to unlock the second slot for NFT Weapon Orb and can start to use 2 Orbs together. Any **Neutral** Orbs can be used in conjunction with an **Elemental** Orb. But 2 **Elemental** Orbs can not be used together.

When used together most of the attributes of your orbs will be sum together such as:

&#x20;**Magitek Gas, Active Gas Consumes/s, Bonus Damage when Active, % Bonus PPP Reward**

Except for the case when one of your Orb have 0 durability then all of its attributes will become zero (% Damage buff is still counted though)

For the Stamina cost multiply is mentioned in the previous section, when used 2 Orb together this stamina cost will be multiplied together, for example: Using a Orb of Split Epic with Orb of Earth Legendary will resulting a Stamina multiply factor of: \
1.65 x 2.4 = 3.96 if throw focus shoot\
1.65 x 1.8 = 2.97 if throw multi shoot
