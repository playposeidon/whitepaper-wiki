# ðŸ›  Repair/Unbind Orb

### 1. Repair Orb

When Orb Durability is drop to a lower value or go to zero you use the Repair Orb feature in the Crafting menu to repair it back to full Durability. Only Orb that has been bound to a NFT Hero can be repaired. Non bind Orb will probably have the full durability hence doesn't not need repair.

To repair an Orb bound to the NFT Hero Tier-A you will need to have the Repair Kit Grade A and similar for Orb bound to the NFT Hero Tier-B and Tier-C require Repair Kit of Grade B and C

Each Kit will be able to repair up to 10 Durability Point. For example: A Rare Orb with max Durability is 40 and current Durability is 3. The player is still require to use 4 Repair Kits to repair it.

When the % bonus PPP of the Orb is reduced by half then one Kit will be able to repair double the amount of Durability Point. For example: an Epic Orb starting with 8% bonus PPP, when reach 2% bonus PPP, each Kit will be able to repair up to 40 Durability Point. Based on this fact, for every orb rarity, when it reach the minimum % bonus PPP you will need to used only one Kit to repair it to full Durability.

These Kit will be sell in the in-game Store. Prices of these kit will be shared later.
