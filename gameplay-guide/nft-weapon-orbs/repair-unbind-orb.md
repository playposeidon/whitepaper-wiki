# ðŸ›  Repair/Unbind Orb

### 1. Repair Orb

When Orb Durability is drop to a lower value or go to zero you use the Repair Orb feature in the Crafting menu to repair it back to full Durability. Only Orb that has been bound to a NFT Hero can be repaired. Non bind Orb will probably have the full durability hence doesn't not need repair.

To repair an Orb bound to the NFT Hero Tier-A you will need to have the Repair Kit Grade A and similar for Orb bound to the NFT Hero Tier-B and Tier-C require Repair Kit of Grade B and C

If the Orb have % bonus PPP Reward already drop to 0 then each Kit will be able to repair up to 40 Durability Point (Except for **Common Orb** can't be repaired if % bonus PPP is drop to zero).
