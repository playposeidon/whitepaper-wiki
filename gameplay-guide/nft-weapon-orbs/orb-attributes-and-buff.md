**Magitek Gas** (max Mana): Weapon Orb has a gas bar which will be used when the Orb is activated. When Weapon Orb ran out of gas, it became inactive. Gas is slowly refueled by converting Pet exhaust energy of Pet magical attack into magitek gas. (Higher rarity pet will allow it to recover gas faster)&#x20;

**% Base Damage Buff:** this buff work similar to Pet Attribute bonus buff but only affect Hero base damage. This buff will always be in effect regardless of the Orb is in active or inactive state. When mint the NFT Orb this % buff will be exactly equal the sum % buff of the 2 NFT Pets combine

{% hint style="info" %}
**Active Gas Consume/s:** This is the amount of Magitek Gas (Mana) that get deducted every seconds when you active the Orb. If the Hero equipped more than 1 Orb, These attribute will be sum together: **Magitek Gas, Active Gas Consumes/s, Bonus Damage when Active, % Bonus PPP Reward**

**Bonus Damage when Active**: This amount increases Hero base damage when the orb is Activated. This bonus base damage can be further increased by upgrading Orb to higher Level(see Orb Upgrade). This amount will not be increased by any Attribute Bonus Buff

**Durability**: For every match this Weapon Orb is used. An amount of durability points will be deducted. 1 point of durability is deducted when you farm 10% of Hero daily farm-cap. That means if you fully farm your hero daily farm-cap, 10 points will be deducted. After that if you continue to use the Hero (equipped with Weapon Orb) your Orb durability will not be deducted since there is no farm-cap left. Once the Orb durability point becomes 0, it can still be used but the Magitek Gas (max Mana) of this orb will be zero. You can still Activate Orbs if the hero is equipped with at least 1 orb still have Durability. And the orb will not give any bonus PPP reward until the player repairs it. Also all passive bonuses coming from Orb will not be in effect, Bonus Damage when Active will becomes zero, leaving only the % Base Damage Bonus Buff. Orb can be repaired by using a Repair Kit, each Kit can repair 10 Durability Points.&#x20;

**\*Common Orb** can only be repaired two times. After the second repair, the Orb will not be able to repair any more.

**% Bonus PPP Reward**: Give bonus reward (**PPP**) based on Hero Daily Farm-cap. This bonus will be reduced by 1% every time the Weapon Orb is repaired. When it reaches 0% it will no longer give a bonus PPP reward. At 0% bonus PPP reward, Orb can still be repaired to be used though (except for Common Orb)
