| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Common**                                       | Hold for 1.2 second to charge up to 2.8X original damage  | Stamina cost is multiplied by **2.38** |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Rare**</mark>        | Hold for 0.9 second to charge up to 2.8X original damage  | Stamina cost is multiplied by **2.1**  |

You need to activate the Orb before you hold to charge your shoot other while it will not be in effect.\
When charge at full damage a special sound effect will be played when you release the mouse/touch. This is to indicate that you have successfully fully charge the shot to full power.\
If you release the mouse/touch before the shot is charged to full power, it will still cost the same amount of Stamina as the fully charge one.

## Combo of Orbs

At Hero LV8 you will be able to unlock the second slot for NFT Weapon Orb and can start to use 2 Orbs together. Most of Neutral Orbs can be used in conjunction with each other except for these special case below:

1. 2 Orb with a same name can't be used together, for example 2 Orb of Split or 2 Orb of Rapid
2. Orb of Rapid and Orb of Charge can't be used together

When used together most of the attributes of your orbs will be sum together such as:

&#x20;**Magitek Gas, Active Gas Consumes/s, Bonus Damage when Active, % Bonus PPP Reward**

Except for the case when one of your Orb have 0 durability then all of its attributes will become zero (% Damage buff is still counted though)

For the Stamina cost multiply is mentioned in the previous section, when used 2 Orb together this stamina cost will be multiplied together, for example: Using a Orb of Split Epic with Orb of Charge Legendary will resulting a Stamina multiply factor of 1.65 x 2.4 = 3.96
