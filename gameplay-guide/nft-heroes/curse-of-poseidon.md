# ðŸ’Š Curse of Poseidon

### 1. Overview

Each NFT Hero will have **20 days** to farm with 100% _Efficiency_. Counting from the mint date or from the moment the Hero last upgrade to next Level. After that, the Hero _Efficiency_ will be **reduced by half every 2 days** due to **** _The curse of Poseidon_ until reaching the minimum 1% Efficiency. This curse of the Olympian god **Poseidon** aim to punish those Heroes whom are lazy to train and help people to fight battle again Sea monsters

For example with 50% _Efficiency_, player will find that they need to play double the number of matches per day compare to normal in-order to fully farm the Hero Farm-Cap. With 25% _Efficiency_, player need to play 4 times the number of matches per day to fully farm the Hero daily farm-cap.

The Hero daily farm-cap is remain the same regardless of how much Hero _Efficiency_ is left. Hero _Efficiency_ is only affect on battle match PPP reward, which increase the time player need to spent into the game to fight battles in-order to fully farmed the Hero farm-cap.

If player decided to rent the NFT to F2P service to play on his behalf, the Efficiency of the Hero will affect the F2P feature in a different way. It will affect the maximum shared ratio to owner for that particular NFT Hero instead of the battle match PPP reward.

For example with 50% Efficiency the maximum shared ratio to owner is reduced by 2 times. With 25% Efficiency, the maximum shared ratio to owner is reduced by 4 times. The minimum shared ratio to scholar is equal to 100% minus the maximum shared ratio to owner.

This curse will be reset every-time the NFT Hero is upgraded to next Level either by **Normal Upgrade** or **Quick Upgrade**. Or Player can use a special item **Elixir of Deep Sea** to reset it just as if the Hero has been upgraded to next Level. If you keep playing the game and willing to upgrade your Hero to next Level, we believe _The curse of Poseidon_ will never touch your hero.

### 2.a Curse Effective Date and Efficiency

On the NFT Hero card, if the Hero is not affected by the _Curse of Poseidon_ yet then there will be a date display on the card (_Yudon_'s Card). This is the Curse Effective Date. Starting from this date, Hero _Efficiency_ will be reduced and the % _Efficiency_ is displayed on the NFT card in-place of the Curse Effective Date (_Mu Qing_'s Card).

Hero _Efficiency_ is only affect on battle match PPP reward, for example a Hero A LV7 used to be able to farm \~200 **PPP** per match on Map LV7 from its farm-cap. With 5% Efficiency you will only receive \~10 **PPP** per match on Map LV7. However you can still playing 100 more matches to fully farm your Hero farm-cap (1010 **PPP**/day)

Based on the Hero Level, The % Efficiency of the Hero will only go as low as the minimum value stated in this table regardless of Hero Tier:

| Hero Level | Minimum Value of Efficiency | Note |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ---- |
| Hero LV1   | 48%                         |      |
| Hero LV2   | 24%                         |      |
| Hero LV3   | 12%                         |      |
| Hero LV4   | 6%                          |      |
| Hero LV5   | 3%                          |      |
| Hero LV6   | 2%                          |      |
| Hero LV7   | 1.5%                        |      |
| Hero LV8   | 1.2%                        |      |
| Hero LV9   | 1%                          |      |

The halving duration of Hero _Efficiency_ is calculated so that it will exactly reach the minimum value after 12 days. Furthermore, there is a **Basic Income** per match to allow player feel their playing time worth. Even if the curse make the Hero _Efficiency_ go very low, a single match reward will never be lower than this **Basic Income** value according to this:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Hero Tier A:**</mark>** 3 PPP** per match
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Hero Tier B**</mark>: **2 PPP** per match
* <mark style="color:green;">**Hero Tier C**</mark>: **1 PPP** per match

This **Basic Income** is subjected to change by the team based on the current Price of **PPP** token. ****&#x20;

### 2.b Hero EXP multiplier factor bonus when at low Efficiency

Once the Hero _Efficiency_ is reduced to a value lower than 50%, for every match that this Hero is used to play (regardless of Normal or F2P), the Hero will receive a bonus in EXP equal to: **1X + 1** of the base EXP reward value. This is similar to as if there is always a **Double EXP +1** Event applied to Hero with _Efficiency_ lower than 50%.

Especially when the Hero _Efficiency_ reach the minimum value corresponding to the Hero LV (table above), then the EXP multiplier factor bonus will become: **2X + 2** (equal to **Triple EXP +2**)\
****This allow the Player whom own the Hero with low _Efficiency_ can quickly level it up to the next LV.

### 3. Curse delay **accumulation** when Upgrade NFT Hero

By default the number of days for Hero to farm with 100% _Efficiency_ is **20 days** counting from the Upgrade or Mint timestamp. But during upgrade NFT Hero, if the current Hero still have a number of days left before the Curse kick-in (before Curse Effective Date), this number of Curse delay days **can be accumulated** together up to a total of **40 days**. With a few exception below:\
LV1 to LV2 can accumulate max 2 days. (total 22 days after upgrade)\
LV2 to LV3 can accumulate max 5 days. (total 25 days after upgrade)\
LV3 to LV4 can accumulate max 10 days. (total 30 days after upgrade)\
LV4 to LV5 can accumulate max 15 days. (total 35 days after upgrade)\
LV5 to LV6 and above can accumulate max 20 days. (total 40 days)

For Quick Upgrade, The number of Curse delay days **accumulated by counting both 2 Heroes**, for example if you have 2 Heroes LV5 with each 10 days left, when merge them together to upgrade to LV6 you will have 1 Hero LV6 with 40 days of 100% _Efficiency_.

But there is a catch, Quick Upgrade will **not allowed to** **merge 2 Heroes with the sum % Efficiency is less than 100%**. For example:\
You can still merge 2 Heroes both with 50% _Efficiency_\
or merge 1 Hero 1% _Efficiency_ and 1 Hero 100% _Efficiency_ together\
But it will not allow to merge 1 Hero 1% _Efficiency_ and 1 Hero 50% _Efficiency_

### 4. Alternative way to reset the Curse of Poseidon

By using an item name **Elixir of Deep Sea**, you will be able to reset the Curse of your Hero back to 100% _Efficiency_. This item can only be acquired by playing the Fortuna mini game **Lucky Spin.** (check this page: [#4.-fortuna-lucky-spin](../../playposeidon/earn-mechanism/gacha-items.md#4.-fortuna-lucky-spin "mention"))

The details on how to use this item to treat _the Curse of Poseidon_ will be released later.

### 5. Curse of Poseidon and Free To Play

If the player decided to rent the cursed NFT Hero (Hero with less than 100% _Efficiency_) to F2P service to play on his behalf, the _Efficiency_ of the Hero will affect the F2P feature in a different way. It will affect the minimum shared ratio to scholar for that particular NFT Hero instead of the battle match PPP reward. It will also lower the Map LV that owner can choose for that Hero.&#x20;

For example, if a Hero A LV5 with 51% **** _Efficiency_ is rent to F2P service, the shared ratio the owner set when create the offer must greater than or equal 49%, and also owner can only choose Map LV3 instead of LV5 to create offer. (Map LV will decrease on a log scale)

There will be no reduce to the PPP reward the F2P match that used this Hero to play. Instead only shared ratio to scholar is now greatly increase. This is to ensure F2P player is able to earn a decent income from those offer created from these cursed NFT Heroes.

Furthermore, when the Curse start to kicked in (<100% _Efficiency)_, the Pet energy deduction for F2P match will become a constant (regardless of Map LV) and based on the Rarity of the Pet itself following the below table:

| Pet's Rarity                                     | Energy point deduct per F2P match | Theoretically max number of match for one day | Note                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Common**                                       | 2                                 | 20                                            | Map LV1 will deduct 1 |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Rare**</mark>        | 1.5                               | 30                                            | Map LV1 will deduct 1 |
| <mark style="color:purple;">**Epic**</mark>      | 0.6                               | 66                                            | All Map LV            |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Legendary**</mark> | 0.15                              | 666                                           | All Map LV            |
| <mark style="color:red;">**Mythical**</mark>     | 0                                 | Unlimited                                     | All Map LV            |

This change in Pet Energy deduction in F2P for Cursed Hero should allow the Hero's offer to be picked up and play a lot of time during a day without the owner have to own a large number of Pets but rather own a few high Rarity Pets. Along with the EXP Multiplier Factor bonus for low efficiency Hero, it shouldn't be long for the Hero gain enough EXP to level up to the next LV when put into F2P mode.
