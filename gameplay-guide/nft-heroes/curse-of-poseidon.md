# ðŸ’Š Curse of Poseidon

### 1. Overview

Each NFT Hero will have **20 days** to farm with 100% _Efficiency_. Counting from the mint date or from the moment the Hero last upgrade to next Level. After that, the Hero _Efficiency_ will be **reduced by half every 2 days** due to **** _The curse of Poseidon_ until reaching the minimum 1% Efficiency. This curse of the Olympian god **Poseidon** aim to punish those Heroes whom are lazy to train and help people to fight battle again Sea monsters

For example with 50% _Efficiency_, player will find that they need to play double the number of matches per day compare to normal in-order to fully farm the Hero Farm-Cap. With 25% _Efficiency_, player need to play 4 times the number of matches per day to fully farm the Hero daily farm-cap.

The Hero daily farm-cap is remain the same regardless of how much Hero _Efficiency_ is left. Hero _Efficiency_ is only affect on battle match PPP reward, which increase the time player need to spent into the game to fight battles in-order to fully farmed the Hero farm-cap.

If player decided to rent the NFT to F2P service to play on his behalf, the Efficiency of the Hero will affect the F2P feature in a different way. It will affect the maximum shared ratio to owner for that particular NFT Hero instead of the battle match PPP reward.

For example with 50% Efficiency the maximum shared ratio to owner is reduced by 2 times. With 25% Efficiency, the maximum shared ratio to owner is reduced by 4 times. The minimum shared ratio to scholar is equal to 100% minus the maximum shared ratio to owner.

This curse will be reset every-time the NFT Hero is upgraded to next Level either by **Normal Upgrade** or **Quick Upgrade**. Or Player can use a special item **Elixir of Deep Sea** to reset it just as if the Hero has been upgraded to next Level. If you keep playing the game and willing to upgrade your Hero to next Level, we believe _The curse of Poseidon_ will never touch your hero.

### 2. Curse Effective Date and Efficiency

On the NFT Hero card, if the Hero is not affected by the _Curse of Poseidon_ yet then there will be a date display on the card (_Yudon_'s Card). This is the Curse Effective Date. Starting from this date, Hero _Efficiency_ will be reduced and the % _Efficiency_ is displayed on the NFT card in-place of the Curse Effective Date (_Mu Qing_'s Card).

Hero _Efficiency_ is only affect on battle match PPP reward, for example a Hero A LV7 used to be able to farm \~200 **PPP** per match on Map LV7 from its farm-cap. With 5% Efficiency you will only receive \~10 **PPP** per match on Map LV7. However you can still playing 100 more matches to fully farm your Hero farm-cap (1010 **PPP**/day)

### 3. Curse delay **accumulation** when Upgrade NFT Hero

By default the number of days for Hero to farm with 100% Efficiency is **20 days** counting from the Upgrade or Mint timestamp. But during upgrade NFT Hero, if the current Hero still have a number of days left before the Curse kick-in (before Curse Effective Date), this number of Curse delay days **can be accumulated** together up to a total of **40 days**. With a few exception below:\
LV1 to LV2 can accumulate max 2 days. (total 22 days after upgrade)\
LV2 to LV3 can accumulate max 5 days. (total 25 days after upgrade)\
LV3 to LV4 can accumulate max 10 days. (total 30 days after upgrade)\
LV4 to LV5 can accumulate max 15 days. (total 35 days after upgrade)\
LV5 to LV6 and above can accumulate max 20 days. (total 40 days)

For Quick Upgrade, The number of Curse delay days **accumulated by counting both 2 Heroes**, for example if you have 2 Heroes LV5 with each 10 days left, when merge them together to upgrade to LV6 you will have 1 Hero LV6 with 40 days of 100% Efficiency.

But there is a catch, Quick Upgrade will **not allowed to** **merge 2 Heroes with the sum % Efficiency is less than 100%**. For example:\
You can still merge 2 Heroes both with 50% Efficiency\
or merge 1 Hero 1% Efficiency and 1 Hero 100% Efficiency together\
But it will not allow to merge 1 Hero 1% Efficiency and 1 Hero 50% Efficiency

### 4. Alternative way to reset the Curse of Poseidon

By using an item name **Elixir of Deep Sea**, you will be able to reset the Curse of your Hero back to 100% Efficiency, the details on how to use this item to treat _the Curse of Poseidon_ will be released later.
