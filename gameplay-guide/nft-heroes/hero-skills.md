Due to the nature of the skill, **Multi throw and Focus throw are Mutually exclusive**. Player need to toggle between these skill when playing. (These 2 skill are acquired starting from Hero LV3)

### **Bouncing throw**: <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Rec_Bounce_skill.png" alt="" data-size="line">

Your Hero's arrow will bounce when it hit the monster or hit the ground. Bounce throw arrows can keep bouncing for a limited number of time based on this skill LV. For example: Bounce throw LV1, arrow will bounce one more time. LV2 bounce two more time, and so on and so on.&#x20;

However the damage of the Pierce will be reduced after the first hit follow this table:

Due to the nature of the skill, **Bouncing throw and Piercing throw are Mutually exclusive**. Player need to toggle between these skill when playing. (These 2 skill are acquired starting from Hero LV2)

#### Skill Combination

Even though **Multi,Focus** throw **are Mutually exclusive** and **Bouncing/Piercing** throw also **are Mutually exclusive.** Combining throw skill from first pair with another one in second pair is possible. For example: Hero can throw a **Focus Piercing** arrow or **Multi Bouncing** arrows or **Focus** **Bouncing** or **Multi** **Piercing**, resulting 4 combination in totals.&#x20;

Below are the throw skills and Hero level scaling table:

## 2. Cast skill

When the Hero equipped the NFT Ancient Relic (2022 Q3), he/she will be granted a cast skill which deal a lot of AOE damage. For example: meteors rain down from the sky, earthquake, tornado, sea waves... etc. Details will be released soon.&#x20;

## 3. Ultimate Skill

When your **Hero** reach **LV6**, he/she will be granted a very powerful ultimate skill which can deal a large amount of damage in a focused area. Each **Hero** will have an unique **Ultimate Throw** skill which will require some training to be mastered. All Ultimate will have a starting cool-down of 30 seconds and a 60 seconds cool-down after used. So theoretically can be used twice in a normal battle.

In general, **Ultimate Throw** can be divided into 3 types:

\+**Type 1, Straigh**t: The NFT Hero shoot arrow straight to the aim point where the mouse is clicked (or finger touched) at a fast rate. Due to the strong recounter force of the ultimate the aim point may be drift higher as the player keep holding the mouse or finger to shoot. Player need to hold it down to control it accuracy.\
Heroes using ultimate type 1: _**Mikasa**_, _**Shana**_ and _**Kaiya Paddley**_

\+**Type 2, High Angle**: The NFT Hero shoot arrow into the air at a high angle and will be fall back to the ground at the aim point where the mouse is clicked (or finger touched) at a very fast rate. Due to the strong recounter force of the ultimate the actual point where the arrow is fall may be drift away from the aim point as the player keep holding the mouse or finger to shoot. Player need to release the mouse/finger and click/touch again to retain the accuracy.\
Heroes using ultimate type 2: _**Yudon**_, _**Samihri**_ and _**Sirilla**_

\+**Type 3, Front:** The NFT Hero will throw a large number of arrow in the front at the aim point where the mouse is clicked (or finger touched) at a very slow rate. There will be no recounter force for this type but player still need to guess where most arrows will land and click/touch the right point on the screen to maximized the damage.\
Heroes using ultimate type 3: _**Mu Qing**_, _**Arya Xu**_ and _**Freya Aloy**_
