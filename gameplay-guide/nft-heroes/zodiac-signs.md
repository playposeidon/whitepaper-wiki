### 2. Zodiac Element

Each Zodiac is corresponding to one of 4 element:

* Earth :rock:
* Water :ocean:
* Fire :fire:
* Air :cloud\_lightning:

Since **Hero** have multiple Zodiac signs, each one may correspond to a different element. Hence **Hero** may have multiple **elements attribute**.

These **elements attribute** will make a different when your Hero is fighting elemental **Boss** monster (in Q2-2022).

Also will allow your **NFT** **Hero** to use _elemental_ **NFT Weapon Orb** to its max potential, significant boosting your hero strength and earn more reward. (in Q3-2022)

Each **NFT Hero** will have a set of element and a primary element, for example a **NFT Hero** Tier B have Zodiac: **Aries** - **Libra** - **Libra** will resulting to **Fire** - **Air** - **Air** as element set **** with the primary element is **Air** (dominant element).&#x20;

**NFT Hero** Tier A have zodiac: **Aries** - **Cancer** - **Capricorn** will resulting to **Fire** - **Water** - **Earth** as element set, for this Hero due to the balance in elements the primary element of the Hero may be switched between any of the 3. By default Hero will have the first one, **Fire** as primary element, but if the current zodiac element is **Water** or **Earth**, the primary element of this Hero will be switched to **Water** or **Earth** based on the current zodiac.

Each element will give a damage buff to the Hero, according to this:

* Earth :rock: : Give 5% earth damage&#x20;
* Water :ocean: : Give 5% water damage&#x20;
* Fire :fire: : Give 4% fire damage
* Air :cloud\_lightning: : Give 5% air damage

And the primary element will extra buff to hero as well, according to this:

* Earth :rock: : Give 5% earth damage + Slightly Increase Stun duration
* Water :ocean: : Give 5% water damage + Make the Slow effect slightly stronger
* Fire :fire: : Give 6% fire damage&#x20;
* Air :cloud\_lightning: : Give 5% air damage + Knock-back effect push monster back slightly further

For example, a Hero with **Fire - Air - Air** will resulting to these buff: 4% fire damage + 15% air damage + better Knock-back effect.  A Hero with **Fire** - **Water** - **Earth** and **Fire** is the current primary element will resulting to: 10% fire damage + 5% water damage + 5% earth damage

{% hint style="info" %}
The damage of Hero when activate with **Elemental** Orbs is **elemental damage** (which will be increased by Hero elements).&#x20;

While in non active state or Hero only using **Neutral** Orbs, the Hero will deal **neutral damage** (will not be increased with Hero elements)

The damage caused by Pet passive skill Fire-ball, Ice-ball, Earth-ball, Wind-ball is also consider **elemental damage** and will be increased by the elements of paired Hero.&#x20;
