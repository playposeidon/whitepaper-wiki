# ðŸ†™ Upgrade Hero LV

### 1. Hero Experiences and Normal Upgrade&#x20;

#### 1.1 Hero EXP required

Each individual Hero that you owned have an Experience bar. In order to level up your hero you need to use your Hero to fight battles and gain EXP. Once the bar is filled up you will be able to upgrade your Hero to next level. If you don't upgrade then your Hero EXP will not be increased above the Max EXP bar even if you keep using the Hero to fight more matches.
