# ðŸ“±    Metamask setup for mobile

Metamask can be installed on [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask\&hl=en\_US\&ref=producthunt&\_branch\_match\_id=739701339152755845)**.** Once MetaMask has been downloaded and installed, you may proceed to create an account.

The steps to create an account are outlined below:

1. Click on the "Create New Wallet"
2. Create a password. This will be used when logging in.
3. View your secret seed phrase and write it down on a secure location.
4. Select each phrase in order and click "Confirm".

{% hint style="info" %}
Your seed phrase will be used if you want to import your wallet to a fresh MetaMask install on a different browser and/or device.

Never give your seed phrase out to anyone. This can be used similar to your password to access your account.

PlayPoseidon devs and mods will never ask for your seed phrase and password.
{% endhint %}

## Connecting to the Binance Smart Chain

After you create an account on MetaMask, it will default to the Ethereum Mainnet.

PlayPoseidon requires your wallet to be set to the Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.

The steps to add the BSC network are outlined below:

* Go to the Settings menu by clicking on the tab icon in the upper left hand side of the screen.
* Choose Network then Add Network

{% endhint %}
