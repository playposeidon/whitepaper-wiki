# ðŸ’¢ Casual Boss

Casual Boss will randomly appear when Player fight battles from **Map LV4** **and above**. The chance to encounter casual boss is based on these factors below:\
\+The Level of the Hero vs the Level of the boss\
\+The number of consecutive win of the current Hero at the boss Map Level\
\+The rarity of the boss\
\+The Tier of the current Hero\
\+The Rarity of the current Pet

The reward is given when player able to defeat the Boss consist of:\
1.Treasure Shard: Can be combined into a Common Treasure\
2.Bonus EXP to Hero\
3.Bonus Treasure: If the hero win rate vs Casual Boss is high enough

Each NFT Hero can encounter Casual Boss an unlimited number of battles per day (reward less of Win or Lost). But only the first **12 Casual Boss encounters** give treasure shards (1) when defeated, after that Boss will not give any more treasure shards but only bonus EXP to Hero (2). Furthermore if Hero is able to defeat a high enough number of Boss in those first 12, the Hero will receive bonus treasure (3). This limit will be reset at 0:00 AM UTC every day.

All rewards and encounter chance can be found in the below excel file: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1njVAy9xBMvdFcvTuIywuVBDl\_doV6A6rzWS0f8f75Hg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1njVAy9xBMvdFcvTuIywuVBDl\_doV6A6rzWS0f8f75Hg/edit?usp=sharing)
