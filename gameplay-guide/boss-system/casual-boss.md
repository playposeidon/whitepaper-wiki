### 1. Encounter Chance

Casual Boss will randomly appear when Player fight battles from **Map LV4** **and above**. The chance to encounter casual boss is based on these factors below:

* The **Level** of the Hero vs the Level of the Boss: **Hero LV** is higher vs **Boss LV** the better
* The number of **consecutive win** of the current Hero at the boss Map Level: Each consecutive win will **double** the encounter rate, This will be **reset** if player **lost** a match or after fight Boss.
* The rarity of the Boss: For example, player will encounter <mark style="color:green;">**VeryRare**</mark> boss more than <mark style="color:purple;">**Epic**</mark>/<mark style="color:yellow;">**Legendary**</mark> Boss
* The **Tier** of the current Hero: <mark style="color:yellow;">**A-Tier**</mark> and <mark style="color:purple;">**B-Tier**</mark> have a better chance to encounter Boss than <mark style="color:green;">**C-Tier**</mark>
* The **Rarity** of the current Pet: <mark style="color:purple;">**Epic**</mark>/<mark style="color:yellow;">**Legendary**</mark>/<mark style="color:red;">**Mythical**</mark> Pet will increase the chance to encounter <mark style="color:purple;">**Epic**</mark>/<mark style="color:yellow;">**Legendary**</mark> Boss.

The reward is given when player able to defeat the Boss consist of:\
1.Treasure Shard: Can be combined into a Common Treasure\
2.Bonus EXP to Hero\
3.Bonus Treasure: If the Hero win rate vs Casual Boss is high enough

Each NFT Hero can encounter Casual Boss an unlimited number of battles per day (reward less of Win or Lost). But only the first **12 Casual Boss**  (**6** **for** <mark style="color:green;">**C-Tier**</mark> **Hero**) **** encounters give treasure shards (1) when defeated, after that Boss will not give any more treasure shards but only bonus EXP to Hero (2). Furthermore if Hero is able to defeat a high enough number of **Boss** in those first **12 (or 6 for** <mark style="color:green;">**C-Tier**</mark> **Hero)**, player will receive bonus treasure (3). This boss treasure reward limit will be reset at 0:00 AM UTC every day.

The Treasure Shard reward is calculated based on the Boss Rarity, Boss Level and Hero Grade. For example:\
Boss <mark style="color:green;">**VeryRare**</mark> have 4 time less reward than <mark style="color:purple;">**Epic**</mark> and <mark style="color:purple;">**Epic**</mark> have less reward than <mark style="color:yellow;">**Legendary**</mark>\ <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark>Boss **LV4** have 2 time less reward than Boss **LV5** and **LV5** have less reward than **LV6**\
****When fighting the same Boss Rarity and Level, <mark style="color:yellow;">**A-Tier**</mark> Hero will receive more reward than <mark style="color:purple;">**B-Tier**</mark> and <mark style="color:purple;">**B-Tier**</mark> will receive more reward than <mark style="color:green;">**C-Tier**</mark>
