# ðŸ—º Campaign Mode

Every **Stages** in PlayPoseidon game in Campaign Mode is split out into different **Maps** which the difficulty level is match with Hero Level power. For example: Map LV1 Stages can be completed by Hero LV1 quite easily but the same Hero will find it very difficult to complete Map LV2 Stages.

Each **Map** contain 6 or more Stages, in a same Map Level the difficulty of each stages is likely the same. But the HighScore rewards for those 2 Stages at the end of Map is slightly better than first 4  Stages.
