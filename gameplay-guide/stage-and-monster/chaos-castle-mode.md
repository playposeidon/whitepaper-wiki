Then you will be able to see a \[Fight] button. In each floor of Chaos Castle, you will need to defend a series of 4 stages with the 4th stage is alway a boss stage. Keep in mind that your Hero HP bar will carry over to the next stage. For example if you lost half of your HP in the 1st stage, when fight 2nd stage you will start with half your HP (instead of full).

As of now only the first floor is unlocked for player to challenge. Second floor (5th to 8th) and Third floor (9th to 12th) will be unlocked soon.
