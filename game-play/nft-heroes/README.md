Each hero will have a daily farm-cap which is based on the Hero Tier and Hero Level. This farm-cap will gradually recover during the day (fully recover within **24 hours**) and increase based on Hero Level.

To upgrade hero level player need to use the hero to fight many battles to gain experiences. Once the hero have enough EXP, player can upgrade to next level by paying a small fee. Alternatively there is a way to quick upgrade hero level without gaining full EXP bar.
