### 1.1 Initial Unlocked Supply after IDO

Initial Unlocked Supply after IDO: **3,145,000 PPP (3.145%)**\
****Initial Market Cap: 3145000 x 0.068 = **$213860 USD**

{% hint style="info" %}
0.125% (Seed Sale) + 1.56% (Private Sale) + 0.66% (IDO Public Sale) + 0.6% (FairLaunch) + 0.2% (AirDrop) = 3.145%
{% endhint %}

75% of total amount's raised in **FairLaunch PinkSale + Pre-Sale IDO** round are used to create the **Liquidity Pool** for **PPP/BNB** pair in [Pancake Swap DEX](https://pancakeswap.finance)

### 1.2 Token Distribution Schedule

![PPP Distribution Schedule](../.gitbook/assets/PPP\_Distribution\_schedule.JPG)

## 2. Deflationary mechanism

**PPP** Token is a **Deflationary** token, it has a **transaction fee of 5%** whenever a transfer is made between holders' addresses. With a whitelist exception below:

1. Transfer from/to Game Contract address (In-Game Treasury):
   * Purchase NFT Hero, NFT Pet, NFT Items In-Game
   * Claim reward from In-Game Treasury to player wallet
   * Used for In-Game features: Upgrade Hero, etcâ€¦
2. Transfer from/to All Vesting-Wallets (Time-Lock contract) such as:
   * Team Vesting-Wallet
   * Investor Vesting-Wallet
   * Game Treasury Vesting-Wallet
   * Marketing Fund Vesting-Wallet
   * Liquidity Pool Vesting-Wallet
   * Staking & Farming Vesting-Wallet
3. Transfer from/to Staking Contract, Farming Contract of Partner such as:
   * Pancake Swap Staking
   * Autofarm Finance
   * Alpaca Finance

Out of **5%** in the Transaction fee, **3% will be burned**. And the remaining **2% will be transferred** to the Game contract address (**In-Game Treasury**). This is to support people whom actually playing the game and prevent token price from being manipulated.

And when the total supply of PPP becomes less than or equal **50,000,000** (50% of capped supply) **all** **5% fee will be transferred to In-Game Treasury**.
