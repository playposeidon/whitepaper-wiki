# ðŸ’¹ Game Economics

The **PlayPoseidon** team understand that as a Player before you purchase NFTs in a P2E game you would like to know what should be your expected return of your investment. That why we have created a comprehensive and details excel file in this page: [daily-income-tier-hero-grade.md](../earn-mechanism/daily-income-tier-hero-grade.md "mention")&#x20;

In general the average **Annual ROI** is currently at **1000%-1300%** (depend on **Hero Level**, **Zodiac** set). Every quarter, when we release new set of **NFT Heroes.** Existing NFT Heroes Annual ROI may be reduced to encourage player to buy new NFT Heroes. This is also make a game fair between old players and new players. **** &#x20;

The average Annual ROI can also be increased or reduced based on the amount of **Game Treasury** reserve is left. This ensure the game is stable in the long run. Player will be able to participate to vote on this decision whether to increase/decrease and how much.

To control the economics of the Game on a daily basis, we are using **A Dynamic Tax system.** This system is designed to benefits those Player who reinvest their daily income **PPP** back **** into the game or diamond hand holder while discourage others from cashing out their entire Game assets. The token itself is also a **Deflationary** token which will increase in value over time. This completely remove the needs for a second Token like other P2E games for example: THG/THC (Thetan Arena) , HTD/CGC (HeroesTD)

With this mechanism, in the game will have 2 type of **PPP** token:

1. **Unclaimed In-Game** **PPP** token: Earn by playing the game
2. **On-chain PPP** token: Receive when you claim your **In-Game PPP** token after Tax deduction

Both these type of token can be used interchangeable for all features in the Game such as: Purchase item in GameShop, MarketPlace, Upgrade Hero,.. Check out details below:&#x20;

#### Purchased NFT Items with Unclaimed Reward

Player is allowed to use both the unclaimed In-Game PPP and On-Chain PPP to purchased items from In-Game Shop such as: **Totem** and **Egg**

**Purchased NFT from In-Game NFT Market Place**

When you sell NFT via The In-Game NFT Market Place, you will received In-Game PPP only. In exchange we will not charge any commission fee and also you can keep using your NFT Hero/Pet to play while let them being listed on the Market Place.

For buyer, both unclaimed In-Game PPP and On-Chain PPP can be used to purchased items from In-Game NFT Market Place.

#### **Crafting** **NFT** **that** **give** **ROI** buff (Q3-2022, Boss Treasure)

In 2022 Q3, we will release a new NFT Weapon Orb (ERC-721) which can increase a Hero ROI when it is bond with a NFT Hero. Crafting NFT will require player to acquired many Crafting Materials either from Boss drop Treasure or purchase via In-Game NFT Market Place. Hence this will urge many Player to upgrade their Hero, reinvest their PPP to boosted their daily Income.

#### PPP staking via NFT farming (Q4-2022, NFT Land)

Once NFT Land feature is out, Player maybe able to stake their PPP token via NFT farming features which will give a decent APY based return.
