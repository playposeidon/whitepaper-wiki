# ðŸ¥‡ Daily Income Tier (Hero Grade)

### 1.NFT Hero daily farm cap

Each **NFT Hero** in Play-Poseidon can allow NFT owner to earn **PPP** by defeating monster in quest **Stage** . But there is a farming cap per day for each NFT Hero. Once players farm full cap of the Hero, he will no longer be rewarded PPP and need to wait for the farm-cap to regenerated. However he still be able to use the Hero to keep playing the game as normal to level up the Heroâ€™s experience. This farming cap varies between Tier (**Hero Grade**) and is roughly geometric progression by **Hero Level**. Below is the expected\* daily **farm-cap** table for different **Hero Grades** with **Annual** **ROI** for each **Hero Level** calculated at the bottom:

\*This may not be the actual number when the game is launched. Number here is used to illustrate the different between Grade Income Tier. The tier scale is guaranteed to be at least 5 time different though.

**Annual ROI** may also get significant increased by **Zodiac Signs** of NFT Hero, for example a super rare **Triple** zodiac sign **Hero** <mark style="color:purple;">**Grade B**</mark>** Level 4** get triple daily income (21 **PPP**/day) during 1 month period.

Note: There is a Quick upgrade feature which can allow quick level up but in-exchange for double investment cost (scarified another NFT Hero of same level)
