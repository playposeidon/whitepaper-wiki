# ðŸ¥‡ Daily Income Tier (Hero Tier)

### 1.NFT Hero daily farm cap

Each **NFT Hero** in Play-Poseidon can allow NFT owner to earn **PPP** by defeating monster in battle. But there is a farming cap per day for each NFT Hero. Once players farm full cap of the Hero, he will no longer be rewarded **PPP** and need to wait for the farm-cap to be regenerated. However he still be able to use the Hero to keep playing the game as normal to level up the Heroâ€™s experience. This farming cap varies between **Hero Tier** and is roughly geometric progression by **Hero Level**. Below is the expected daily **farm-cap** table for different **Hero Tier** with **Annual** **ROI** for each **Hero Level** calculated at the bottom:

**Annual ROI** may also get significant increased by **Zodiac Signs** of NFT Hero, for example a super rare **Triple** zodiac sign **Hero** <mark style="color:purple;">**Tier B**</mark> Level 4 get triple daily income (**105** **PPP**/day instead of **35 PPP**/day) during 1 month period.

Note: There is a Quick upgrade feature which can allow quick level up but in-exchange for double investment cost (merge two NFT Hero of same level)
